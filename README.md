# School marks
My son is in school. To motivate him, I came up with a reward program for good grades in school subjects. Initially, I counted the grades manually. Then I wrote a program that counts grades instead of me. This is how this project came about.

## TODO
- [ ] add instruction by steps
- [ ] add message if marks "0"
- [ ] add web-page
